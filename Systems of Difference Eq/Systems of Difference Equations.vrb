\begin{theorem}
	A necessary and sufficient condition for the system of difference equations to be globally asymptotically stable is that all eigenvalues of the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ have moduli strictly less than 1.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
	If all eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}$ have moduli strictly less than 1, the difference equation is globally asymptotically stable and every solution converges to the constant vector $\mathbf{(I - A)}^{-1}\mathbf{b}$.
\end{theorem}
